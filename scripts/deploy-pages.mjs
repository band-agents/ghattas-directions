/**
 * Build the site and publish it to GitHub Pages.
 *
 *   npm run deploy:pages
 *
 * Lands at https://band-agents.github.io/ghattas-directions/ with the views at
 * #overview, #nocturne, #porcelain and #ascend.
 *
 * Vite's base is "./" and routing is by hash, so the build works under any
 * sub-path as it is: no VITE_BASE, and no 404.html fallback.
 *
 * The publish is a throwaway git repo inside the staging directory, force
 * pushed to gh-pages, so that branch only ever holds build output. git runs
 * WITHOUT a shell: on Windows `shell: true` re-parses the arguments and splits
 * a commit message into pathspecs. npm needs the shell there (npm.cmd).
